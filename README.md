# ios-coreml
A template iOS app demonstrating the use of the CoreML framework

## Notes
1. I have included the smaller-sized models in the repository. You can download the other models from [this page](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/), where Apple hosts them. 
2. The code is somewhat repetitive, I will come back and revise it when I find some time.
